        <p><em>Founder and Managing Director of <a href="https://farthingcommunications.com"><strong>Farthing Communications</strong></em></a></p>
        <p>Over the past decade I've pioneered the use of marketing automation in SMEs, International NGOs and political
          campaigns. Helping them build stronger relationships and increase their revenue. I've done this as a senior
          marketing manager and as a communications consultant for international businesses and high profile non-profits.
          Past clients include Oxfam in Vietnam, regional law firms, large video production companies, financial advisers,
          Save the Children and Georgetown University. Recently I acquired an MBA from a top UK business school and
          professional qualifications in strategic management and consulting. I currently manage my own boutique
          marketing automation firm and run a campaign group called Devolve.</p>
